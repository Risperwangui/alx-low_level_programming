Question 0:
Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned bit.
Question 1:
Wrte a function that prints the binary representation of a number.
Question 2:
Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
Question 3:
Write a fumction that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
Question 4:
Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
Question 5:
Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
Question 6:
Write s function that checks the endianness.
